## Introduction

**mskcc/loki** is a bioinformatics pipeline that calculates Copy Number Variation (CNV) mutation data from a Tumor/Normal Bam pair. The pipeline uses MSKCC Facets/Facets-suite and calculates pileups using MKSCC Htstools.

![Loki graph](docs/images/Loki.png)

1. Calculate pileups ([`htstools`](https://github.com/mskcc/htstools/releases/tag/snp_pileup_0.1.1))
2. Calculate CNV results ([`Facets-suite`](https://github.com/mskcc/facets-suite/releases/tag/2.0.9))

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
pairId,tumorBam,normalBam,assay,normalType,bedFile
pair_sample,/bam/path/foo_tumor.rg.md.abra.printreads.bam,/bam/path/foo_normal.rg.md.abra.printreads.bam,IMPACT505,MATCHED,NONE
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure the bams have an index file associated with it either file.bam.bai or file.bai should work

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

<!-- TODO nf-core: update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->

```bash
nextflow run main.nf \
   -profile singularity,test_juno \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).
